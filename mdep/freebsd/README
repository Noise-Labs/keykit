To port KeyKit 6.2a to FreeBSD 2.1.7, the linux mdep files were modified
in a single afternoon. Therefore, while the program appears to work well,
there may be lurking bugs because of the speed of the port. Please
report any FreeBSD-specific bugs with KeyKit 6.2a to both Tim Thompson
(me@timthompson.com) and Warren Toomey (wkt@cs.adfa.oz.au).
