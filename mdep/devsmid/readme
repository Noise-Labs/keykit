This is a minimal device driver that provides a /dev/smid that
talks to an MPU-compatible MIDI hardware interface.  This version
is streams-based.  It has been run on System V Release 4 (both
an AT&T version and the ESIX 4.0.3 version).  It is not known
how easily it will port to SVR3 systems.  To install, invoke (as root):

     ./Install

The hardware interrupt # and address will be requested interactively.
Included in this directory are testread.c and testwrite.c programs.

Make sure that the address you specify is not also used by other
devices in your system.  For example, ISC's version of UNIX
uses address 0x330 for the Adaptec SCSI controller, so you'd want
to avoid using that address.  Some MIDI interfaces don't let you
change anything, but the MusicQuest MIDI interface is a good
MPU-compatible MIDI controller that allows you to change both the
IRQ and address.
