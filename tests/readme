You can run all tests with:

	sh keytest.sh

If keytest.sh isn't here, look in the mdep directory.
To create a new test, just make a {test-name}.k  file, and
execute "Test -s {test-name}".   This creates the {test-name}.sav
file, which is the 'good' output from the test.

The .k files are keykit language tests.  The .mf files are Standard
MIDI files, and .m5 files are midi(5) files.
