Hi Burton,
     Here is a description of the changes I made.

- By adding "..\users\beerma" to the Keypath value in the liblocal\prerc.k
  file, your code is automatically loaded.  So, all you need to do is
  start keykit and type "WaterLilies()" to run it.

- All the old versions of your code are in the "old" sub-directory.
  Because the names of the function (burton1) was the same in all of the
  files, it caused confusion.

- I'm assuming that WaterLilies.k contained the most recent version.

- I put the "utility" functions (like lookandkill) into a util.k
  file.

- The function in WaterLilies.k is now named WaterLilies()  (Upper and
  lower-case is significant.)
