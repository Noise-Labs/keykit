This file contains the documentation for the Backing Generator for 
Keykit.

The Backing Generator generates a backing track from predefined style 
track. This may be a midi track or keykit phrase. Styles may include 
drum tracks. Midi or phrase tracks may also be layered over the 
generated style. The system has a variety of commands to provide the 
needed functionality.

Chords

Chords are specified by a note (in keykit note format) followed by a 
"." then a chord type (maj, min etc), followed by a "-" and a beat 
count. Optionally a beat offset may be specified by a "+" followed by 
the offset.

ie   note.type-count+offset
     f+.min7-4+4 is a f#min7 chord played for 4 beats,                  using beats 4-8 of the style.
     e.maj-2     is a emaj chord played for 2 beats,
                 using whichever 2 beats of the style 
                 are appropriate to its position in the 
                 song.

Chord offsets are used primarily for effect and only apply for the 
beats specified.

The defined chord types are

Commands

Backing Generator commands are used to control many aspects of the 
generated output. All commands start with "x"

The basic commands are as follows

tempo -
xt=120	 this sets the tempo to 120 crochet beats per minute
xt=80-16 this changes the tempo from the current value to 80 
         over the next 16 beats

beat -
xb=4/4   this defines the beat as 4 crochet beats per  bar. 
         this should be correctly defined for the 
         style definition. using different time 
         signatures can give higher beat resolution
         ie 8/8 is the same as 4/4 but twice the beat resolution

rest -
x-=4     this defines a 4 beat rest.

offset -
xo=4     this offsets the style on a global basis. this
         is used to counter the effect of a 4-beat 
         count-in, or to shift the start of a
         verse/chorus to the start of a style.

The following sections deal with the phrase and style commands. These 
commands have subcommands, and each will be dealt with individually.

style subcommands-

load, add
xsl=
xsa=
    m{afile.mid}<1|2>Name:1-s,2-s,7-d,8-d
    m{afile.mid}<1|2>Name
    p{afile.k}<1|1>Name
    p{afile.k}<1|1>Name:1-d

        the load command loads a new style. this
        deletes the current styles and drum tracks.
        the add command adds additional styles.
        a phrase can have only one track (1). a midi
        style can have multiple tracks. midi track 0 is 
        always ignored (it is the tempo track). all
        channel information is stripped from the tracks.
        each midi track is assigned a name created from 
        Name-tracknum ie "Name-1", "Name-2". These names
        are used to modify tracks. tracks are defined as 
        style (s) or drum (d). the default assignments
        are "1-s,2-s,3-s,4-s,5-s,6-s,7-d,8-d" for midi
        and "1-s" for phrases. the index info in <>
        defines how a style is extracted from a library.
        the first number is the index, the second is the 
        size (in bars). thus <2|2> defines bars 2-4 of 
        the midi file. <2|3> defines bars 3-6.

remove
xsr=TRACK-1,TRACK-2
        remove tracks.

modify
xsm=Track:p-xx,v-xx,k-kitcommand
        modify a track 
        p changes the patch number
        v changes the volume
        k modifies the style track with one of the
          following commands
               reverse      reverse the track
               double       double the track
               revpitch     reverse the pitch order
               upoctave     move up an octave
               dnoctave     move down an octave
               step         move notes to beat divisions
               even         make all notes even
               swap         swap every two notes 
               shuffle      swap halves
               echo         echo notes (adds 1 bar)
               firsthalf    use first half
               secondhalf   use second half

phrase subcommands

xpl=p{phrase file path}<pitchshift>name:1-s
    m{midi file path}<pitchshift>name:1-s,2-d... 
        phrases are loaded into tracks. identification
        is similar to style tracks. a pitchshift may be
        applied.
