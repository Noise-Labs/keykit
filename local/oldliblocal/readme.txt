This directory can contain any local additions to
the standard KeyKit environment.  The standard Keypath value
should contain this directory *before* the standard KeyKit library.

If you want to add a new tool, just put the *.k
files into this directory, and add a line for the tool
to the "tools1.lst" or "tools2.lst" files in this directory,
to add them to the Tools1 or Tools2 menus.
