KeyKit - Musical Fun with Windows, Tasks, and Objects

by Tim Thompson (me@timthompson.com)

See top-level makefile for instructions on compiling.  See the doc directory
for other documentation.  In particular, see doc/porting for details
on the machine-dependent support needed for a given platform.

Most of the machine-dependent support in the mdep directory is obsolete
and will no longer work without modification, but is being retained
for potential future use.

When you see "nt" (e.g. the mdep/nt directory, or the install_nt target
in the makefile, it refers to the Windows version.  The fact that it refers to Windows NT
indicates just how ancient KeyKit is.  :-)
